Synthetic Metagenomics Simulator v 1 Feb 2013

This pipeline is used to simulate illumina shotgun sequencing data. The major
task of this pipeline is to generate metagenomic data while whole genome
sequencing data can also be created.

======Input Files======

1. Relative abundance files for community (required)
The only input files that should be provided by users are the abundance files.

Where to put it
You shall put your relative abundance files in input folder.

Format
1) Tab-delimited plain text files with two columns.
2) First column is the name of bugs, usually this should be a name specifying
genus or genus + species. No higher level shall be included.
3) Second column is the relative abundance for each bug. It should be the
fraction of each bug in the community or normalized by some constant.
4) Currently we cannot handle empty line within files. This function will be
added soon.

Example
Example community abundance files can be found in input/abun_ref folder.

2. Error model
Optionally, users can also supply an error model file as input. This should be
generated by GemErr.py and should be a collection of information in some real
sequencing data. For details of generating the error model data by GemErr,
please refering to GemSIM homepage (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gemsim/).

We have distributed an error model file within our repository. You can find it
in input/error_model. It is based on aligned Illumina sequencing data. More detail can be found in GemSIM paper (doi:10.1186/1471-2164-13-74).

=========================================================================
You can modify the number of reads generated in SConscript.

You should include rby_test1.py (slightly modified GemRead.py) in your PATH.
This pipeline treats it as an external script. It is included in src/

You should modify the path to FastqToSam.py (used to generate bam files from fastq files) in your Sconscript files. This pipeline treats it as an external script. It is included in src/.

It uses fasta files, KO reference files and taxonomy table from /n/CHB/data/IMG_v350. So please make sure you are in hutlab server or you can modify the path to these files in SConscript file (use absolute path).
For taxonomy table path: modify c_pathInputTaxonDir
For reference genomes path: modify c_pathInputGenomeDir
For reference KO files: modify c_pathKO
